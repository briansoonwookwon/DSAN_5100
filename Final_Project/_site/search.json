    "text": "This project looks at specific audio features among the top five most streamed spotify artists of 2022. We used the spotify API to download information on seven audio features for each of the five most streamed artists: BTS, Bad Bunny, The Weeknd, Taylor Swift, and Drake. The features studied are: Accousticness, Danceability, Energy, Loudness, Speechiness, Tempo, and Valence. We performed exploratory data analysis to determine our hypothesis, and then performed three different hypothesis tests to determine which features were common among the artists. We performed T-Tests, Wilcoxon Ranked Sum tests, and bootstrapping tests. We found that the tempo was the same among all of the top five artists, but all of the other audio features were different for at least one artist."
