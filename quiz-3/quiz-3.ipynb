        "It is common to produce film franchises based on books. For example, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter series, Twilight Saga, Hunger Games...etc. But sometimes the book fans don’t like some of the movies in the sequel (For example: I’m a huge Harry Potter books fan but I didn’t like the 4th and 5th movies much). Assume that a producer needs to choose a new book series for his movie sequel and ask you to do research on people **who read ALL the books** and liked the movies based on these books. Assuming that you decided to go with the best movie franchises based on books (as listed above), you will be choosing books with $6$, $7$, $8$, $9$ books in the series and people who liked $3$ or $6$ movies in the sequel. Out of $160$ random people you surveyed, you observed the following results. The following table indicates the number of people who liked the books in the series ($X$) and the movies in the sequel ($Y$).\n",
