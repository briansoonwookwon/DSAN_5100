DSAN 5100: Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Computing

Probabilistic models are essential for the understanding of data that are affected by uncertainty. This course introduces students to the fundamentals of probabilistic modeling and then covers computational techniques for the analysis of such data. After introducing basic concepts and approaches such as probability distributions, random variables, and conditioning, the course covers basic probability distributions that are frequently used in practice and some of their properties, such as Laws of Large Numbers. In the second half, students will learn about computational techniques for the use of probabilistic models. This includes methods for faithful simulation of random variables (Monte Carlo), the extraction of condensed models from observed data (maximum likelihood, Bayesian models), methods for models with hidden or partially observed variables (latent variables, expectation-maximization, hidden Markov models), and some general data science techniques that incorporate probabilistic models (graphical models, stochastic optimization).
