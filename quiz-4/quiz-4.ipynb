        "Markov chains are used in many real-life applications. One example is that they can be used in board games played with dice. A game of Chutes and Ladders or any other game whose moves are determined entirely by dice is a Markov chain - more specifically, an *absorbing* Markov chain. This is in contrast to card games such as Blackjack, where the cards represent a \"memory\" of the past moves. You can read how Markov chains have been applied in the Chutes and Ladders game here: (<a href=\"https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2014/REUPapers/Hochman.pdf\">Chutes and Ladders - Michael Hochman</a>, pages 2, 6, and 7).\n",

        "Assuming you are working for a company who creates games, create a game to which you can apply a Markov chain process (this could be any game and it doesn’t have to involve rolling a dice, but it can if you want to. It can also be a completely different other game) and where you can find probabilities of the player's moves. Be creative and use your imagination! Define the rules and how a player can win the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two conditions that your game must satisfy:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Condition (i): The game should have at least **5** states and at most **10** states (this means that the minimum number of states that you should consider in the Markov process is 5 and that the maximum is 10).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Condition (ii): Also, it needs to be a **Markov process**. That is, it should be a stochastic process (a process that evolves in time) that has the Markov property(the transition probability from one state to another only depends on the current state). Also, the summation of all outgoing probabilities from each state (the sum of each row of the transition matrix) should be 1.\n",

That is, as we draw more samples, the mean of sample means is very close to population mean (standard deviation of the sample mean equals the population standard deviation divided by the sample size). This allows researchers making assumptions on population mean based on the sample mean when they don’t know true population distribution. Also they can do hypothesis testing or construct confidence intervals. For example, you want to know the average number of M%Ms per bag. Obviously, it is impossible to buy all M%M bags and know the exact distribution of the number. Therefore, you can collect as many samples as possible and assume the mean number of M&Ms will follow the normal distribution as you collect more samples. \n",

        "Maximum Likelihood Estimation is a statistical technique to estimate the parameters given the data. It is finding a parameter that maximizing the likelihood function which is a function of a parameter given data. It is important when you are trying to tell how the parameters of a model represents the observed data. MLE converges to a true population parameter when the sample size gets larger, yet it doesn’t always converge when maximum likelihood is obtained in multiple points. Also it is sensitive to outliers that can leads to biased estimations as we are underpredicting the population variance. Compared with other estimation methods, MLE is robust yet computationally more complex. Bayesian estimation works better in small sample sizes and dealing with outliers. Using the M&M example and assuming the number of M%Ms follow normal distribution, we can estimate the mean. We opened 10 bags and each bag has 6,6,7,8,6,6,7,8,9,7 respectively. Knowing that MLE of mean in normal distribution, we can estimate the mean by taking the sample mean of those 10 bags, which is 7.\n"
